# Repositories

## Adding URLs to the zip of a repository

Instructions on how to add repos from which to install add-ons usually involve typing long URL strings, which is extremely unpleasant on a TV using a remote control, so here is a way to use SSH instead.

In `/storage/.kodi/userdata/sources.xml` in the `<files>` section, add sections like

```
        <source>
            <name>Kodinerds</name>
            <path pathversion="1">https://repo.kodinerds.net:443/webdav/</path>
            <allowsharing>true</allowsharing>
        </source>
```

Then restart Kodi.
