# Media player setup guides

Nowadays there's tons of cheap embedded media player hardware available from China. For under 30 EUR, you can get tiny player modules capable of decoding 4K material (at 30fps at most, of course).

These modules normally ship with some outdated and highly customized (well, crappified) Android. Luckily, there's much better alternative Linux distros available for most boards already.

This repository contains some setup notes taken while trying to set those up with better distributions. Most of the time successfully, sometimes not, often with some issues which may be resolved.
