# aml_autoscript

Amlogic-based systems have a mechanism involving a file called `aml_autoscript` that allows one to execute U-Boot commands from external media such as SD card or USB mass storage.

Unfortunately, the exact workings of `aml_autoscript` seem to be undocumented.

So here is what we have figured out. Feel free to correct.

## aml_autoscript theory of operation

* When an Amlogic system detects that the reset button ("toothpick method") has been pressed during power-up, it (probably the stock U-Boot on the device) searches for a file called `aml_autoscript` on external media such as SD card or USB mass storage (this is known to work at least for the first partition if it is formatted fat32 - to be documented whether it also works for other partitions and filesystems) (Possibly newer U-Boot versions can also handle ext4 with commands such as ext4load)
* For models based on Amlogic S802/S805/812 this might NOT work from USB but only from SD card (to be verified). This might be due to an older U-Boot version installed from the factory on those machines. (To be determined whether this limitation can be lifted by using a newer U-Boot.)
* The file `aml_autoscript` can be created by editing a text file `aml_autoscript.txt`, and then running `mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -d aml_autoscript.txt aml_autoscript`
* `aml_autoscript.txt` can contain U-Boot commands
* It should be possible to chainload a newer U-Boot from `aml_autoscript`. To be determined: Will newer (mainline) U-Boot also search for and execute `aml_autoscript`? If so, how can we avoid an infinite loop?
* Usually `aml_autoscript` scripts set some variables, store them, and then reboot the system (`setenv key value`, `saveenv`, `reset`). This is so that one does not have to power-up with the reset button being pressed all the time in order to boot what the `aml_autoscript` is supposed to boot. But `aml_autoscript` scripts can also be used to directly boot something, without the need for `saveenv`. This is especially interesting if a certain action should ONLY be executed/booted if the reset button is being pressed during power-up, and subsequent boots should boot as usual

In some instructions you will read that you need to boot into the stock Android, go to the "Backup & Restore" app, and select a zip file to "activate multi-boot". Probably the same effect can be achieved by using `aml_autoscript` and powering up with the reset button pressed ("toothpick method"). This needs to be verified.

Note: On some 3rd-party systems you might also see `s905_autoscript`. This seems to be something introduced by @150balbes, not something official from Amlogic. Hence it is not covered here.

## printenv, getenv, setenv, saveenv

U-Boot can store U-Boot environment variables persistently. To show them, run `printenv`. To set an U-Boot environment variable temporarily, run `setenv <key> <value>`. To persist all set U-Boot environment variables across boots, run `saveenv`.

There are some special U-Boot environment variables that determine how Amlogic systems are booted.

https://github.com/150balbes/Amlogic_S905-u-boot/blob/master/common/cmd_reboot.c defines

* reboot_mode (`normal`, `factory_reset`, `update`, `usb_burning`, `suspend_off`, `hibernate`, `crash_dump`, `kernel_panic`, `charging`) - __to be documented__

According to https://github.com/longsleep/u-boot-odroidc/blob/master/arch/arm/include/asm/arch-m6tvd/reboot.h,

```
/*
 * Commands accepted by the arm_machine_restart() system call.

There are probably many more. Need to be documented.

## Loading custom boot logo

There seems to be a U-Boot environment variable that determines how the boot logo is loaded, e.g,

`prepare=logo size ${outputmode}; video open; video clear; video dev open ${outputmode};imgread pic logo bootup ${loadaddr_logo}; bmp display ${bootup_offset}; bmp scale;`

It seems to be possible to replace this by something that reads the logo from a file on SD/USB instead: https://github.com/linux-meson/meta-amlogic/blob/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-odroidc1/0004-Loading-bootlogo-with-ext4load-instead-of-movi.patch

According to https://github.com/linux-meson/meta-amlogic/blob/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-odroidc1/odroidc1/boot.ini the following should work for loading and displaying a bootlogo. The image needs to be a 24-bit Windows BMP image only and default size is 1280Ã—720. An example image is at https://github.com/linux-meson/meta-amlogic/blob/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-odroidc1/odroidc1/bootlogo.bmp?raw=true.

```
logo size ${outputmode}
video open
video clear
video dev open ${outputmode}
ext4load mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr_logo} /boot/bootlogo.bmp
bmp display ${loadaddr_logo}
bmp scale
```

## Disabling HDMI

According to https://github.com/linux-meson/meta-amlogic/blob/master/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-odroidc1/odroidc1/boot.ini,

```
# Disable VPU (Video decoding engine, Saves RAM!!!)
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
setenv vpu "1"
if test "${vpu}" = "0"; then fdt rm /mesonstream; fdt rm /vdec; fdt rm /ppmgr; fi

# Disable HDMI Output (Again, saves ram!)
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
setenv hdmioutput "1"
if test "${hdmioutput}" = "0"; then fdt rm /mesonfb; fi
```

## Open questions

Feel free to contribute

* Can Android be booted from SD card and/or USB? How?
