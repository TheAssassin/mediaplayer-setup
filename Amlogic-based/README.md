# Amlogic SOCs

The [Linux Meson](http://linux-meson.com/doku.php) project is there to bring Amlogic SoC support into the mainline Linux kernel.

As of 4/2020 this is in a bootable state, although not all distributions are using the mainline kernel yet.

Unfortunately, the Linux Meson project's documentation on how to boot into e.g., Debian using the mainline kernel is not very clear. Any insights appreciated.
